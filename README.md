# [campLeaderboard](https://mattmatters.github.io/leaderboard-redux/)

This is an experimentation in using asyncronous actions in redux.  Here it requests [these](https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent) [two](https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime) json files and then uses react to re-render the view.


## Installation

Assuming you already have yarn:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/mattmatters/leaderboard-redux.git"
cd leaderboard-redux
yarn install
```

Upon installing you may type `yarn start` to run the application through a dev server.
